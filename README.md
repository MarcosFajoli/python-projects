# python-projects
Projects written in Python 3.5

## Objective
Learn more about how Python works, with minigames and other small projects.

After creating these projects, my intention is to start creating an API to return some information about games, in Python and Django

## How to play
Download this repository and run the [jogos.py](https://github.com/MarcosFajoli/python-projects/blob/master/jogos.py) file to access the main menu and choose the games.
